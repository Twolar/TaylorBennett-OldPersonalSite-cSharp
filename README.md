# Personal Website for Taylor Bennett
- This is a demonstration web app/site, not being deployed as other alternatives for a personal website are cheaper.

- Has login capability, there is also capability for users to be an admin (currently only allows one, which is my login). Admin priveleges reveal the option to and allow you to create new and edit blog posts.
- Backend service is an API that serves the data for Blogposts (utilises SQLite for its DB).  
- Portfolio page pulls from two different APIs, first is github, where the website grabs a list of all public repositories. 
- Second API call gets a raw formatted README for each repository and displays it.


### Built using:
- ASP.NETCORE 2.2
- SQLITE
- RAZOR PAGES
- HTML/CSS (BOOTSTRAP)
